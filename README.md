# WhiteBoard_RMI
`Final score: 22.5/25`

> The purpose of this project is to design a shared whiteboard to enable multiple users to access concurrently. The whiteboard application is accomplished through RMI to achieve multi-thread. That is, the whiteboard service is registered by a host and a client can connect to the service via a remote object without building a connection to other clients. The functionalities of the whiteboard application contain drawing, text insertion, and message exchange. The host/manager can execute save, load, and clear method to manip ulate the draw panel. The host can also decide who can join the whiteboard and kick out users.
